3. Open `Easy Grab VR/Demo/Scenes` to find the demo scenes.

For OpenVR Rift support please import

1. [Oculus Platform SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-platform-sdk/)

## Customization
You can customize how each object in your scene is handled and how it acts.

Take a look at the `SVGrabbable` component to customize how the object acts when held, and how it picked up.

Take a look at the `SV Controller Input` component to customize what buttons grab your object.
